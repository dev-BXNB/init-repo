        <p class="textContent slide">
          Hey there! I’m James, a passionate web developer focused on crafting meaningful digital experiences. My
          approach to development is all about creating intuitive, user-centered websites that don’t just look good, but
          also drive results for the people who use them.
        </p>
        <p class="textContent slide">
          I believe that websites should do more than just function – they should feel right. Whether I’m designing a
          new intuitive interface, or developing some unique location on the internet, my goal is to build digital
          experiences that leave a
          lasting impression.
        </p>

        <p class="textContent slide">
          When I’m not coding, you can find me playing free fire, shooting hoops at the basketball court,
          or talking to a friend on Discord.
