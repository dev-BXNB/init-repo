# DOCUMENTATION

## INTRODUCTION

### Overview

I'm looking forward to building exciting digital experiences for businesses and individuals alike. This website is my first step.

### About

I built this website to have a practical test of my knowledge of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I started learning web development in February of 2025, and this website is a culmination of all I have learned.

### Who is it for?

Obviously, it's made for me! Lol üòÅ. But really, it's made for potential clients to have a gauge of my current abilities in web design and development. The layout was heavily inspired by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com) - I respect her a lot.

## CHALLENGES

While I have prior experience, I encountered challenges typical for someone early in their development career. One key challenge was designing a clean layout in **landscape mode** for mobile devices. I am addressing this by extensively experimenting with the **CSS** `overflow` property to achieve a more responsive design.

Also, I'm having issues with reflecting updates on mobile browsers. I'm working on it using _Vercel_. I may be doing the wrong thing, but I'll make sure to not make a mistake twice. üòâ

### Problem being solved & Importance

- Personal branding; How I'm perceived by prospective visitors and clients
- Attract opportunities
- Demonstrating my professionalism
- Showcasing my skills and abilities

## PROCESS

### Research & Planning

While analyzing and reviewing portfolio sites for inspiration and identification of modern design different from the trend, [Brittany Chiang's](https://brittanychiang.com) held my attention the most. I was focused on creating a minimalist digital experience that reflects my ethos - "Building eXperiences, Not Bricks."

I mapped out the structure for my website focusing on easy navigation and distinct sections. I chose a frontend tech stack - **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with _Vercel_ for deployment.

### Design & Development

I designed my mockups to create a mobile-friendly design which emphasizes simple layout, simple text, and subtle animations. I made a mistake by not using a mobile-first approach, but this is the last time it will happen.

I mean, most internet traffic comes from mobile devices. I recognize this as a learning opportunity, and I'm committed to refining my approach. The website is based purely on **HTML, CSS, and JS**. The interactivity is handled by JavaScript, and animations by CSS.

### Lessons Learned
- The importance of mobile-first design
- Continuous improvements through mistakes
- Balancing aesthetics and functionality
- Research and inspiration matter
- Personal branding and professional presentation

### Conclusion

While I've not learned a ton, I'm trying my best to apply all that I'm learning along the way.
Thanks for coming this far, I appreciate you. üòâ
